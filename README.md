# Expense_tracker

This is a flutter project that can use to track our expenses. I have added more features like updating the expense, updating the expense and save at the same position , undo the updates , seperate between update and new expense like features here. Further, the app is fully responsive and adoptive so that any device nor orientation can use this app seamlessly. Further this app can change the UI to lark mode and dark mode by recognizing the system preferences and also the messages stylings are also changed according to your platform whether IOS or Android.
